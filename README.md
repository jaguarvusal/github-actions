# CI/CD Deployment Setup  
**GitHub Actions for Cypress Tests & Render Deployment**

This repository demonstrates a CI/CD pipeline using GitHub Actions to automate testing and deployment. Cypress component tests run automatically on every Pull Request to the `develop` branch. When changes are merged from `develop` to `main`, the application is automatically deployed to [Render]https://github-actions-3asc.onrender.com.
